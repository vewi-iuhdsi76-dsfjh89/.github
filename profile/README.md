## Lee & Simone Biles Support Each Other experience

Sharing her experience has also helped Suni when it comes to battling eczema. And recently, the 21-year-old partnered with Eli Lilly and Company, Team USA's health equity sponsor, to help others with the same diagnosis feel less alone.

“I feel like it started off really hard because I always felt so insecure and, I guess, embarrassed to say I had eczema or even show the symptoms,” Suni said. “I know when I had a breakout and it was really noticeable, I always tried to cover it up with my makeup, which ended up making it worse. So it didn't help in the end. But I think being able to talk about it and also associate with Lilly it's been such an amazing thing for me mentally because I feel so much more confident in my own skin and now I can just embrace it.”

“I think that's the message I want to send to the younger generations,” he continued, “because when [I was younger](https://hdmoviesworld.xyz), I don't think a lot of people talked about it. So to be someone that other people can do. It's kind of admirable. great feeling all around.”

And whether the three-time Olympic medalist adds more hardware to her trophy shelf or not, she's proud of how far she's come.

“I think he would give me a medal for not giving up,” Suni said. “I mean, there have been so many things that I could have given up on and so many things that have happened where I could have put that aside and moved on with my life. But I wanted better for myself and I also wanted to be able to walk away from these Olympic Games or this quad knowing that I gave everything I had and didn't regret anything.”

Mudrex, a Web3 company that offers crypto investment services, announced a new reward initiative for its user base in India on Tuesday, June 11. Called “Earn”, this service will allow Mudrex users to earn up to 10 percent annual income from their crypto holdings without any lock-in period. India's crypto community is taking gradual steps to engage with the sector given the nation's skeptical approach to digital assets. Mudrex's new initiative appears to be a move aimed at retaining Indian users on its platform.

In the first phase of the deployment of this service, Mudrex has listed 50 cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ether Solana, Cardano and Polygon, holding which can earn up to ten percent in rewards for holders. The reward percentage for holding each of these different cryptocurrencies is different.

“To participate in Earn, users must maintain a minimum balance of eligible coins in their Mudrex wallets. [By participating](https://hdworldmovie.com/) in a combination of short-term ventures such as margin financing and fund allocation in secure and long-term DeFi protocols, Mudrex aims for a steady stream of fixed annualized returns from 0.023 percent maximum to 10 percent of its investments,” the company. he said in his statement.

The crypto community in India has grown to a user base of 19 million, according to a CoinSwitch report estimated in December last year. Almost 75 percent of cryptocurrency holders were between the ages of 18 and 35. However, due to India's crypto tax laws, the density of India's crypto user base is prone to see ups and downs.

In a separate report the same month, WazirX claimed it saw a 90 percent drop in crypto trading volume as India awaited clarity on regulatory rollouts.

Crypto earnings in India are taxed at up to 30 percent. [The governmen](https://worlddailymovies.online/)t also levies one percent TDS on every crypto transaction, a rule that has stirred up negative sentiments among the investor community since it came into existence in 2022. Despite several pleas from the finance ministry, these crypto laws remain without changes in the country. This situation has led many crypto players in India to come up with special offers that could keep their users connected to their platforms.

For example, in November 2023, Indian crypto exchange CoinSwitch launched its own “Earn” feature, to allow users to “lock” their crypto assets and earn rewards in the form of cryptocurrencies. The platform had said at the time that this was the exchange's way of allowing its users to monetize their holdings without having to sell.

Speaking about Mudrex's decision to launch this initiative, its CEO Edul Patel said, “We aim to empower our users to maximize their crypto earnings by eliminating fees and simplifying the process.”

According to the company, the beta phase of the Earn program has already managed to attract more than 5,000 users.

“We also plan to expand the range of supported coins, continuously [improving](https://dailynewstechnology.com/) the value proposition of our platform for users,” Patel added.
